# What is Supreme Chi-Town Coding Crew?

Supreme Chi-Town Coding Crew (SC3) is a loose team of volunteer software developers. SC3 educates Chicagoans in practical, professional development skills and develops useful web applications.

# How do I join?

Come to OpenHack at FreeGeek Chicago, every Saturday from 1pm-5pm at 3411 W. Diversey. Details available on the [FreeGeek Chicago calendar](http://freegeekchicago.org/calendar).

# Our goals

* We will be as diverse as Chicago. Everyone is welcome, whatever their skill level.
* We will do outreach among people outside of the mainstream IT industry to recruit those excluded because of economic, racial, gender, and generational bias.
* We will prioritize and teach practical web development skills and fundamentals using popular, widely used tools, platforms, and standards.
* We will use loose consensus in face-to-face meetings to make decisions.
* We will release our software under free software licenses.
* We will build open web APIs when our software uses and processes data.
* We will build web applications that investigate and interrogate Chicago and beyond.
* We will connect members to professional opportunities, especially stable, well-paid jobs.
* We will create user friendly software.
* We will have a blast.

# Governance

Decisions such as what projects we'll tackle and licenses we'll use will be 

Consensus means that for a formal decision, decision-makers may:

* Agree: You'd like to get on board.
* Step aside: You have reservations or simply no resources to contribute to the decision, but you don't oppose it.
* Veto: You get one veto for life. If you veto a proposal, it will not be considered again. 

# Copyright

The FreeGeek Chicago community and all contributors will share the copyright to SC3 intellectual property on a per-project basis.

# Evolving model

Like FreeGeek Chicago early on, we'll use the consensus process to refine and improve this document.
