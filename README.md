# What is Supreme Chi-Town Coding Crew?

Supreme Chi-Town Coding Crew (SC3) is a loosely organized team of volunteer software developers who educate Chicagoans in practical, professional development skills and who collaboratively develop useful web applications.

# Who is Supreme Chi-Town Coding Crew?

* Jimmie Glover
* David Eads

# How do I join?

Come to OpenHack at FreeGeek Chicago, every Saturday from 1pm-5pm at 3411 W. Diversey. Details available on the [FreeGeek Chicago calendar](http://freegeekchicago.org/calendar).

# Our goals

* We will be as diverse as Chicago. Everyone is welcome, whatever their skill level. 
* We will do outreach among people outside of the mainstream IT industry to recruit those excluded because of racial, gender, and generational bias.
* We will prioritize and teach practical web development skills and fundamentals using popular, widely used tools, platforms, and standards.
* We will release our software under free software licenses, primarily the GNU GPL version 3.
* We will build web applications that investigate our city.
* We will build open APIs when our software uses and processes data.
* We will be governed by consensus by a group of 3 - 10 project maintainers.
* We will do our best to get people stable, well-paid jobs.
* We will make super friendly software.
* We will have a blast.

# Governance

* Big decisions such as what projects we'll tackle and licenses we'll use will be made by formal consensus (see below) by everyone with administrative privileges on the SC3 Github account (https://github.com/sc3).
* For the moment, anyone with administrative privileges can give anyone else administrative privileges.
* Anyone may submit a proposal to be considered using consensus on the Github issue tracker.

# Formal consensus

Consensus means that for a formal decision, decision-makers may:

* Agree: You'd like to get on board.
* Step aside: You have reservations or simply no resources to contribute to the decision, but you don't oppose it.
* Veto: You get one veto for life. If you veto a proposal, it will not be considered again. 

# Evolving model

Like FreeGeek Chicago early on, we'll use the consensus process to refine and improve this document.
